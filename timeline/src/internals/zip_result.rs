    // Example: "cartoon pause" vs "pause cartoon". Let's say pause is play-state-timeline, and cartoon is play-type-timeline.
    // For some reason, we tracked the play type to be cartoon for t1-t2 at time X, and the fact that it was paused came in only the same time period t1-t2 (say at X + 10 just to show its delayed),
    // Given we were trying to zip play_state.zip_with(play_type), the fact of "pause" should be merged towards the left side of value "cartoon".
    // Also another subtility here is, we are not building functions in the recursion by not calling merge at `Both` node.
